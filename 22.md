**Out Degree**: O(|V|+|E|) or O(|V|) if we store list length. The idea is to iterate over all vertices(u ∈ V) and find length of each Adj[u]. Length of each Adj[u] indicates the outward edges or out degree    
**In Degree**: We iterate over all vertices and for vertex v ∈ Adj[u] we keep count of every time v occurs in Adj[u<sub>1</sub>], Adj[u<sub>2</sub>], Adj[u<sub>3</sub>], ... Adj[u<sub>V</sub>] as Count[v]. The final in degree of each vertex is given by Count[v]. Another way would also be *transpose* the graph and calculate out degree as above. Both cases runtime will be O(|V|+|E|).

## 22.1-3
**AdjList**: We iterate over all the vertices u in V. For each v in Adj[u<sub>1</sub>], Adj[u<sub>2</sub>]... we keep adding u<sub>1</sub>, u<sub>2</sub>... to NewAdj[v]
```
newAdj[V]
for(u=1; u<=|V|; u++):
    for( v in Adj[u]):
        newAdj[v].push_back(u)

Memory: O(|V| + |E|) Time: O(|V| + |E|)  
```

**AdjMatrix**:
Transpose the matrix. We assume 0-indexing

```
for(u=0; u<|V|; u++):
    for(v=u; v<Adj[u].length; v++):
        swap(Adj[u][v]);
```

## 22.1-4
We iterate over the vertices. For each u in V and v in Adj[u], there can be two cases -   
- u = v
- v occurs multiple times
Hence, create a new array Arr of size V(this is similar to hashmap except that V should always be in limits hence we are using array directly than hashing). The use of this array is to track parent of each vertex when iterating over Adj[parent]. If v==u or its visited before we skip it.
```
Arr[V]
newAdj[V]
for(u=1; u<=V; u++):
    for(v in Adj[u]):
        if(v==u):
            continue;
        else if(Arr[v] != u): <!-- Check if v is seen before-->
            <!-- Add v to Adj as its first seen -->
            newAdj[u].push_back(v)
            <!-- Set flag so we don't visit it again. -->
            Arr[v] = u

Memory: O(|V| + |E|)                    Time: O(|V| + |E|)
```

## 22.1-5
**AdjList**
Iterate over all vertices u in V and for each v in Adj[u] add v' in newAdj[u] along with v.   
`u -> v -> v'`   
Memory: O(|V||E| + |V|)
Time: O(|V||E| + |V|)

**Matrix**:   
Use matrix multiplication to square the matrix. `O(|V|<sup>2.38</sup>)`  
 See: <link>https://stackoverflow.com/a/1944648  
Reasoning is that the square entry: `C[u][v] = A[u][k]*A[k][v] k=1..V i.e. C[u][v] will be non-zero if u -> k -> v exists as A[u][k] & A[k][v] both needs to be non-zero`
